        Founded in 2009 by Junas Roca as Shirt Stop, G-Prop has grown from a small custom printing business into a trusted provider of souvenirs and event items. Rebranded after the 2022 Quirino Fire, the company now specializes in custom T-shirts, mugs, pins, tarpaulins, slings, and bags. With a skilled team handling both design and production, G-Prop serves clients across the Davao, Cotabato, and CARAGA regions. Operating with a flexible pricing model, they source materials as needed and ensure timely deliveries through private transport.
